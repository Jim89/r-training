# Rstudio notebooks

## Notebooks

[Official documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html)

Let us couple code with explanation and have outputs inline.

Create a new notebook in RStudio with the menu command File -> New File -> R Notebook

## YAML header

The first few lines of your new notebook look like this:

    ---
    title: "R Notebook"
    output: html_notebook
    ---

You can change the `title` to one for your notebook. 

The `output` option tells Rstudio to treat this as a notebook.

## Explanatory text

Add comments and explanatory notes using plain text. 

These should be used to describe the _why_ of your code - the reasons for your analysis.

## Code chunks

You can insert sections of code using a code chunk.

There are three ways to do that:

1. The keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + I
1. The "Insert" button icon in the editor toolbar.
1. By manually typing the chunk delimiters ` ```{r} ` and ` ``` `.

## Code chunks

Once you have entered code in to a chunk, you can run it:

1. Use Ctrl/Cmd + Shift * Enter to run the chunk your cursor is in.
1. Use the `Run` button in the Rstudio interface (small green play button)
1. Use the Run All and Run Previous commands to run a batch of chunks.

The output should appear beneath the code chunk
    
<aside class="notes">
* Use Ctrl/Cmd + Enter to run just the current statement/line.
* Running a single statement is much like running an entire chunk consisting only of that statement.
* Run All will run _all_ chunks in the document
* Run previous will run the chunks _before_ the currently selected chunk
* You can change so output appears in the console/viewer if you prefer
</aside>

## Preview the output

When you're happy with the code in the document, use the Preview button (or Cntrl/Cmd + Shift + K) to convert to the notebook output.

(You'll need to save the file somewhere first).

This will take the current outputs in the notebook, along with the explanatory notes you've added, and convert them to a HTML output.
