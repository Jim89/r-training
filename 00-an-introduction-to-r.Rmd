## Who am I?

* Started with KPMG in 2012
* Analyst in Data Insight Services
* Data scientist in TechSolutions/Lighthouse
* 5 years using and teaching R

## Materials

Available
[online](https://hdp-service.uk.kworld.kpmg.com/stash/projects/JL/repos/r-training/browse).

## Agenda

* [Introduction](https://hdp-service.uk.kworld.kpmg.com/shiny/r-training/an-introduction-to-R.html) to R
* Plotting with `ggplot2`
* Manipulating data with R
* Getting data in to R
* Creating reports with R

## Checkpoint

To help me get an understanding of your level who has:

1. Programmed in R before?
2. Programmed in _any_ language before?
3. Seen R code before?
4. Used Excel/other point-and-click tools for data analysis?

# R and the `tidyverse`

## R

> An _environment_ and a _language_ for data analysis and programming

* Free
* Flexible
* Powerful

## R Growth

```{r growth, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./www/language-growth.png")
```

## Rstudio

A powerful [IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/) for R. 

```{r rstudio, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./www/rstudio.png")
```

## The `tidyverse`

* A [collection](https://www.tidyverse.org/) of R _packages_ with a common approach.

* __Package__: Extra functionality that can be added to R, developed by R users.

* Installed and then loaded with:

```{r eval = F}
install.package("[some_package]")
library(some_package)
```

I.e. for the tidyverse:

```{r eval = F}
install.packages("tidyverse") # Install the package
library(tidyverse) # Load the package
```

## The `tidyverse`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
tidyverse_logo()
```
