# R Training

This repository contains the source R Markdown files used to generate
presentation material for an "Introduction to R" training session.

The files can be used for individual sessions/presentations (although they are
quite light), or linked together for an overall session.

The site was built with R Markdown. See the [official
documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html) for details
on how the site can be built.

A helper script `move-files.sh` can be used by any IXE user with access to the
Shiny server to upload the built site.
